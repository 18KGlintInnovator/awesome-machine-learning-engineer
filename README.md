## Developed by radix.ai

At [radix.ai](https://radix.ai/), we invent, design and develop AI-powered software.

Here are some examples of what we do with Machine Learning, the technology behind AI:
- Help job seekers find a job. On the [Belgian Public Employment Service website](https://www.vdab.be/), we serve job recommendations based on your CV.
- Help hospitals save time. We extract diagnoses from patient discharge letters.
- Help publishers calculate their impact, by detecting copycat articles.

You can follow our adventures on [medium](https://medium.com/radix-ai-blog).
