## What is this and how do I use it?

- This is a curated list of delightful resources for everything you need to develop Machine Learning solutions.
- All resources are structured as follows: *[Content level]* *[Page title]* - *[Description]* (*[Reading time]*).
  - There are three content levels:
    1. :hatched_chick: Essential reading for all ML engineers
    2. :snake: Advanced reading for professional ML engineers
    3. :unicorn: Expert material for expert ML engineers
  - Descriptions are written so that they complete the sentence *"After reading this article you will have learned to ..."*.

## Curated by Radix

[Radix](https://radix.ai) is a Belgium-based Machine Learning company.

We invent, design and develop AI-powered software. Together with our clients, we identify which problems within organizations can be solved with AI, demonstrating the value of Artificial Intelligence for each problem.

Our team is constantly looking for novel and better-performing solutions and we challenge each other to come up with the best ideas for our clients and our company.

Here are some examples of what we do with Machine Learning, the technology behind AI:
- Help job seekers find great jobs that match their expectations. On the [Belgian Public Employment Service website](https://www.vdab.be), you can find our job recommendations based on your CV alone.
- Help hospitals save time. We extract diagnosis from patient discharge letters.
- Help publishers estimate their impact by detecting copycat articles.

We work hard and we have fun together. We foster a culture of collaboration, where each team member feels supported when taking on a challenge, and trusted when taking on responsibility.
